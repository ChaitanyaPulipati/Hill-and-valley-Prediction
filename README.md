# Hill and Valley Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a given geographic area is a hill or a valley based on its topographical features. The prediction model utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the terrain characteristics of different geographic regions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to accurately classify and predict the terrain type (hill or valley) of a given location using its topographical features. By achieving this objective, the project aims to provide valuable insights for applications such as urban planning, environmental analysis, and geological studies.

# Data Source
The data used for this project was collected from the YBI Foundation GitHub page, which serves as a repository for datasets and resources related to the YBI Foundation's initiatives and projects. The dataset provides information on various topographical features of geographic areas, including elevation, slope, aspect, and other relevant attributes.

## Methodology
The project follows the following methodology:

### Data Collection:
The dataset is obtained from the YBI Foundation GitHub page, ensuring the availability of relevant topographical features for each geographic area.

### Data Preprocessing:
The collected dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract additional relevant information from the raw data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
The dataset is analyzed to gain insights into the distribution of topographical features, identify patterns, and understand the relationship between variables. Data visualization techniques are employed to explore the data.

### Model Development:
Machine learning algorithm logistic regression is trained on the preprocessed dataset to develop a prediction model. The model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.


### Results and Evaluation:
The performance of the developed prediction model is evaluated using appropriate metrics . The evaluation results provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting the terrain type.

### Future Improvements
